# grid-hub

Open-source baseline for importing CGMES network data, indexing it for fast exploration, and comparing network states. The architecture follows the GridSuite direction: separate web, service, data, mapping, and infrastructure modules for operating, visualizing, analysing, and designing electrical grids on top of PowSyBl-oriented network import boundaries.

GridSuite references used for alignment: import/explore, interactive study, and modification analysis are key features, and its repositories include separate UI/server concerns such as `gridexplore-app`, `gridstudy-app`, `network-modification-server`, and `study-server` ([GridSuite GitHub](https://github.com/gridsuite)).

## Module Map

This README is the suite entry point. Detailed behavior belongs in each module README.

- `com.utils`: shared utility code, cache abstractions, environment resolution
  in `eu.gridhub.utils.env`, and configuration loading in
  `eu.gridhub.utils.config`.
- `com.mapping`: generic configuration-driven object mapping.
- `com.infra`: reusable backend infrastructure adapters for document storage,
  object storage, and event publishing.
- `com.auth`: OIDC/OAuth 2.0 authorization service backed by Keycloak.
- `doc.arch`: architecture notes, local deployment details, module classification, and the module archetype.

## Build Metadata

- `dependencies.xml` is the Maven parent dependency catalog. It centralizes dependency and plugin versions through Maven-compatible `version.*` property tags, `dependencyManagement`, and `pluginManagement`; it does not add those dependencies to every module.
- `modules.xml` is the standalone module inventory for developer review and automation. Maven requires the active aggregator module list to remain inline in `pom.xml`, so keep both lists synchronized when adding or removing modules.
- Module POMs should declare only the dependencies they directly use. Infrastructure dependencies such as MinIO, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, and Spring Boot belong in backend modules that need them, not in the GUI or data-only modules.

## Quick Start

Start the shared local infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up elasticsearch minio rabbitmq otel-collector
```

Build the backend modules:

```bash
mvn -Ddocker.skip.build=true -Ddocker.skip.push=true test
```

## Common Builds

Build all Maven modules:

```bash
mvn verify
```

Build only the auth service and its dependencies:

```bash
mvn -pl com.auth -am test
```

Build Docker images through Maven:

```bash
mvn -Ddocker.namespace=your-dockerhub-user package
```

Run the full local Docker Compose stack from locally built artifacts:

```bash
mvn -Ddocker.skip.build=true -Ddocker.skip.push=true clean package
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Where Details Live

- Authentication endpoints, Keycloak configuration, and gateway authorization flow: `com.auth/README.md`.
- Configuration loading order, environment resolution, and cache-provider resolution: `com.utils/README.md`.
- Infrastructure adapter contracts and technology ownership rules: `com.infra/README.md`.
- Mapping implementation details: `com.mapping/README.md`.
- Local deployment, environment rules, and architecture guidance: `doc.arch/README.md` and the documents under `doc.arch`.

## Tests

```bash
mvn test
mvn -pl com.auth -am test
```
